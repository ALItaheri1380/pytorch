# Code Repository: Regression, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts implementing various machine learning and deep learning techniques using PyTorch and NumPy. The codes cover a range of topics including regression models, neural networks, and advanced deep learning architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Additionally, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are integrated to demonstrate practical applications in text data analysis.
